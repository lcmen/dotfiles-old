# Collection of my dotfiles

It relies on cloning the repo to `~/Code/dotfiles`. I need to add some fix for that.

## Installation

1. Install Homebrew
2. Run `setup.sh`
3. Run 'rake install' from root of the project.

## Credits

Dotfiles inspired by [strzalek](https://github.com/strzalek/dotfiles) and [jsatk](https://github.com/jsatk/dotfiles/).
